## Linux Scripting

This repo should be a place for bash (shell) scripting tricks and best practice.
There should be some uploaded scripts and theory about bash (shel scripting).


### NOTES About Linux Scripting: ###

- /bin/bash = /bin/sh ?
For a long time, /bin/sh used to point to /bin/bash on most GNU/Linux systems. But that started to change recently (e.g. Modern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink sh to dash by default).
Bash stands for "Bourne Again SHell", and is a replacement/improvement of the original Bourne shell (sh).
What is shell? A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. 
Shell is between user and kernel.
